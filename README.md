### Hello World ! Welcome to Indeed.com 
###### This is the clone of indeed.com Which I was assigned in my React Construct week.

 


## indeed.com
Indeed is a free service to job seekers, where you can upload a resume, create job alert emails, search for jobs, save them and apply to them directly. We include all the job listings from major job boards, newspapers, associations, and company career pages, and employers can even post jobs directly to Indeed that may not be available anywhere else.

We also have a whole section of our website dedicated to Company Pages, where you can read reviews of companies that interest you written by current and former employees.
